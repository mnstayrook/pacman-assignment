# Graphics Animation Random Walk

_Created by Maegan Stayrook_

In her MERN Full Stack Development course, Maegan had a simple exercise to animate four images of PacMan running across the screen with his mouth opening and closing.

As time goes on, she plans to revisit or simply recreate this assignment to implement more features, such as:

- Create a maze like the game for PacMan to run through it.
- Give people the ability to turn PacMan a different direction with arrow keys.
- Implement the ghosts from the original game that would kill PacMan upon impact.
